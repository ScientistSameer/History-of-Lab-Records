# History-of-Lab-Records

![History-of-Lab-Records preview](https://github.com/ScientistSameer/History-of-Lab-Records/assets/2683512/ef306423-3b89-4d0c-be80-9c5c682478d1)

**History-of-Lab-Records** is a responsive admin dashboard template built on top of Tailwind CSS and fully coded in React. It comes with several pre-coded charts (built with Chart.js 3) and widgets, and it's a great starting point for anyone who wants to create a user interface for managing lab records, dashboards for research data, modern web apps, and more.

**UPDATE 2025-12-15** Added Tailwind v4 support and integrated collaboration, researchers, and labs modules with dummy backend APIs.
